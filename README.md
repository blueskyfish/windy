## Motivation

When developing a web application, it is important to design the code as efficiently and clearly as possible.
Unfortunately, it often happens that when creating CSS classes, you repeatedly use the same properties and values.
This can quickly make the code confusing and difficult to maintain.

To address this problem, it makes sense to outsource the common properties into reusable classes or mixins.
This allows the code to be much more compact and readable. It also facilitates later changes, as you only need
to make adjustments in one place.

By using technologies like Sass or Less, developers can also further improve the modularity and structure of
their CSS code. This creates a clean, maintainable codebase that is easy to expand, even for complex web
applications.

### Example

```css
.app-title {
    align-items: center;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    
    .title {
        flex: 1 1 auto;
        white-space: nowrap;
        overflow: hidden;
        text-overflow: ellipsis;
    }
    .icon {
        flex: 0 0 auto;
        margin-right: 0.5rem;
    }
}
```

*The CSS declarations are repeated in this and a similar way*

Wouldn't it be nice if this could be done using simple CSS classes?

```html
<h1 class="wy-align-center wy-flex wy-flex-nowrap wy-flex-row">
    <span class="icon wy-flex-shrink wy-me-2">...</span>
    <span class="title wy-flex-grow wy-truncate">...</span>
</h1>
```
